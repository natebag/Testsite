## QA Integration Protocol
- Each sub-task requires QA review before proceeding
- Performance benchmarks must be documented
- Security implications assessed for each optimization
- User experience impact validated

## Project Context
**Previous Completion:** Task 16.0 - Optimized codebase and build system  
**Next Major Milestone:** Production-ready performance infrastructure  
**Technical Debt:** Monitor for any performance vs. feature trade-offs  

## Current State Analysis
**Build System:** Advanced Vite configuration with code splitting, manual chunks, and bundle optimization
**Performance Monitoring:** Existing performance audit script with budget checks and security validation
**Memory Management:** Comprehensive MemoryManager class with LRU caching, GC optimization, and leak detection
**Architecture:** Multi-page application with React, Solana Web3, and advanced routing system

## Performance Foundation Assessment
- **Current Build Tools:** Vite, esbuild, Terser, bundle analyzer, legacy browser support
- **Code Splitting:** Manual chunks configured for vendor, core, and feature separation
- **Caching:** Advanced memory manager with LRU cache and TTL support
- **Monitoring:** Performance budgets and security header validation implemented
- **Dependencies:** React 19, Solana Web3.js, modern build tooling

## Task 17.1 - Ready for Assignment
**Agent:** security-performance-auditor
**Dependencies:** None - foundation assessment complete
**Current Foundation:** Strong build system and performance monitoring already in place
**Optimization Targets:** Images, components, progressive enhancement, Web Core Vitals

## Session Notes
- Task 17.0 initiated with clear performance objectives
- Multi-agent coordination required across specialized domains
- Critical path through performance optimizations before load testing
- Compliance checking scheduled as final gate before completion
- Strong foundation identified - ready for advanced optimizations
