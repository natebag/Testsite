# Task List Generation Workflow

## Purpose
This workflow converts approved Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) into actionable task lists with detailed sub-tasks, following a systematic two-phase approach for efficient implementation management.

## Process Flow

### Phase 1: Parent Task Structure Creation
1. **Analyze PRD**: Review the complete PRD to understand scope and requirements
2. **Identify Major Components**: Break down the feature into logical parent tasks:
   - UI/UX implementation tasks
   - Backend API and database tasks
   - Integration and testing tasks
   - Documentation and deployment tasks
3. **Create Parent Task Framework**: Generate high-level tasks with:
   - Clear task descriptions and objectives
   - Dependencies between parent tasks
   - Estimated complexity and time requirements
   - Resource allocation recommendations

### Phase 2: Detailed Sub-Task Breakdown
1. **Expand Each Parent Task**: Create comprehensive sub-tasks with:
   - Specific implementation steps
   - Clear acceptance criteria
   - Technical specifications and requirements
   - Testing and validation steps
2. **Add Implementation Details**: Include:
   - Code file locations and naming conventions
   - API endpoints and data structures
   - UI component specifications
   - Database schema changes
3. **Define Quality Gates**: Establish checkpoints for:
   - Code review requirements
   - Testing completion criteria
   - Performance validation steps
   - Security audit requirements

## Output Specifications

### File Format
- **Location**: `/tasks/` directory
- **Naming Convention**: `tasks-[prd-file-name].md`
- **Structure**: Hierarchical task organization with clear parent-child relationships

### Content Requirements
- **Task Hierarchy**: Parent tasks with detailed sub-tasks
- **Relevant Files Section**: Track all files involved in implementation
- **Dependencies**: Clear task sequencing and blocking relationships
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Specific, measurable completion requirements
- **Implementation Notes**: Technical guidance and best practices

### Task Structure Template
```markdown
## Parent Task [N]: [Task Name]
**Objective**: [Clear description of what this accomplishes]
**Dependencies**: [List of prerequisite tasks]
**Estimated Effort**: [Complexity/time estimate]

### Sub-task [N.1]: [Specific Implementation Step]
- **Description**: [Detailed implementation requirements]
- **Acceptance Criteria**: [How to verify completion]
- **Files to Modify/Create**: [Specific file paths]
- **Testing Requirements**: [Validation steps]

### Sub-task [N.2]: [Next Implementation Step]
[Similar structure repeated]

**Relevant Files**:
- [List all files involved in this parent task]
```

## Quality Standards
- All sub-tasks must be independently implementable
- Each sub-task must have clear acceptance criteria
- File modifications must be explicitly documented
- Dependencies must prevent blocking situations
- Testing requirements must be comprehensive

## Integration Requirements
- **Relevant Files Section**: Must be maintained throughout implementation
- **Dependency Tracking**: Ensure proper task sequencing
- **Progress Monitoring**: Support for task completion tracking
- **Quality Gates**: Integration with QA review cycles

## Implementation Protocol
- Tasks generated from this workflow feed directly into `process-task-list.md`
- Each task list must be reviewed for completeness before implementation begins
- Relevant Files section must be updated as implementation progresses
- Parent tasks only marked complete after all sub-tasks are finished
