# Product Requirements Document: MLG.clan Gaming Community Platform

## Introduction/Overview

MLG.clan is a Web3-enabled gaming community platform that creates competitive gaming communities with token-based governance. The platform solves the problem of fragmented gaming communities by providing a unified space where casual gamers can participate in community-driven content curation through voting mechanisms, while earning and spending tokens for enhanced platform privileges.

The platform combines traditional gaming community features (clans, tournaments, content sharing) with Web3 mechanics (wallet connectivity, token economics, decentralized voting) to create an engaging ecosystem where community participation is rewarded and governance is democratized.

## Goals

1. **Community Engagement**: Increase daily active users by 40% through gamified token-based participation
2. **Content Quality**: Improve content quality scores by 60% through community-driven voting curation
3. **Web3 Adoption**: Achieve 80% wallet connectivity rate among active users within 6 months
4. **Token Utility**: Generate 1000+ token burn transactions per month through premium voting actions
5. **Retention**: Maintain 70% user retention rate for users who join clans and participate in voting

**As a community member**, I want to vote on gaming clips and content so that I can help curate high-quality content while earning tokens for my participation.

## Open Questions

1. **Token Economics**: What should be the exact token cost for additional votes and how should this scale with user activity levels?

2. **Content Moderation**: Should there be automated content filtering before community voting, or rely entirely on community-driven moderation?

3. **Clan Governance**: Should clan leaders have special voting powers or content curation abilities within their clan's scope?

4. **Cross-Chain Support**: Is there future intent to support other blockchain networks beyond Ethereum for broader user accessibility?

5. **Tournament Integration**: How should tournament results integrate with the voting system and clan leaderboards for comprehensive community engagement?

6. **Content Monetization**: Should high-performing content creators receive token rewards, and if so, what should be the reward distribution mechanism?
