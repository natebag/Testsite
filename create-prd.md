# PRD Creation Workflow

## Purpose
This workflow creates detailed Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) in the `/tasks/` directory following a systematic two-phase approach optimized for junior developer implementation.

## Process Flow

### Phase 1: Requirements Clarification
1. **Analyze Initial Request**: Review the feature request and identify key components
2. **Generate Clarifying Questions**: Create 5-10 targeted questions about:
   - Business objectives and success metrics
   - User experience requirements and edge cases
   - Technical constraints and dependencies
   - Performance and security considerations
   - Integration requirements with existing systems
3. **Await User Responses**: Collect detailed answers before proceeding

### Phase 2: PRD Generation
1. **Create Comprehensive PRD**: Generate detailed documentation with:
   - Executive summary with clear business value
   - User personas and use cases with specific scenarios
   - Detailed functional and non-functional requirements
   - Technical architecture and implementation approach
   - Dependencies, risks, and mitigation strategies
   - Success metrics and acceptance criteria
2. **Target Junior Developers**: Write clear, actionable requirements that:
   - Include implementation guidance
   - Define clear acceptance criteria
   - Provide context for technical decisions
   - Include error handling and edge case requirements

## Output Specifications

### File Format
- **Location**: `/tasks/` directory
- **Naming Convention**: `prd-[feature-name].md`
- **Structure**: Use standardized PRD template with consistent formatting

### Content Requirements
- **Executive Summary**: Business context and objectives
- **User Stories**: Detailed scenarios with acceptance criteria
- **Functional Requirements**: Specific feature behaviors
- **Technical Requirements**: Architecture and implementation details
- **Dependencies**: Internal and external system requirements
- **Risk Assessment**: Potential issues and mitigation plans
- **Success Metrics**: Measurable outcomes and KPIs

## Quality Standards
- Requirements must be testable and measurable
- Technical specifications must be implementation-ready
- All edge cases and error scenarios must be addressed
- Business value must be clearly articulated
- Dependencies and risks must be thoroughly analyzed

## Integration
- Works with `generate-tasks.md` for task list creation
- Feeds into `process-task-list.md` for implementation tracking
- Supports compliance verification through claude-md-compliance-checker
